    <p>This potato salad is a classic potato salad recipe that is easy to make and serves 8. It's great for picnics, barbecues, or as a side dish for any meal. It's got a great balance of flavors and textures from the potatoes, mayonnaise, mustard, and diced vegetables. It's also a very versatile recipe, so you can easily customize it to suit your tastes. For example, you could add some diced ham or bacon to give it a smoky flavor, or some chopped hard-boiled eggs for extra protein. You could also try using different types of potatoes, such as Yukon Golds or red potatoes, to give it a slightly different flavor and texture. Whatever you choose, I hope you enjoy it!</p>
